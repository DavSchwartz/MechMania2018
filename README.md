3rd place code submitted for MechMania 2018, UIUC's AI programming competition.

A last man standing strategy game played on a connected graph. Combat is rock-paper-scissors.

My team's code uses a predictive algorithm. Rock-paper-scissors "stances" are determined by previous interactions with the opponent, stored in an associative array.

code is in **MyBot.py**
